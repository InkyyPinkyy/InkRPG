# Testing branch no.1 
For testing new features and developing them.  

### here are the things that you can do right now:
- you can create your character by choosing a name and a class
- you can fight truly terrifying monsters to earn xp and gold (which do not have a use by now)
- There is the first attempt of an inventory

### Here are some things that I want to implement:
- [ ] A lot of new events like dungeons, villages and npc encounters
- [ ] consumable items like healing potions
- [ ] reworking the inventory a little bit
