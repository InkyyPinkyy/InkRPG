# This is my first repo
Here, I will start to develop my text-based rpg which does not have a name at this given point of time.  

## What is it all about?
Since childhood, i have a fascination for rpg-games, so naturally, I started to learn how to code and with  
this Repository, my first own rpg is making its way to... maybe someone who will eventually play it.  

### here are the things that you can do right now:
- you can create your character by choosing a name and a class
- you can fight truly terrifying monsters to earn xp and gold (which do not have a use by now)
- There is the first attempt of an inventory

### Here are some things that I want to implement:
- [ ] A lot of new events like dungeons, villages and npc encounters
- [ ] consumable items like healing potions
- [ ] reworking the inventory a little bit
- [ ] autosaving feature
- [x] rewriting the game in english and making it the standard edition
- [ ] reworking of __main__
- [ ] implementing player.class as player.species and introducing player.class as in like warrior, mage or assassin
